The didactic components are integrated with the practical application of ultrasound sonography through scanning labs and on-site application of the knowledge and competencies learned in the classroom. Any student completing any CVIU program will possess complete confidence in pursuing a career in ultrasound sonography. The goals of our faculty, staff, and clinical supervisors are twofold: first, to thoroughly train sonographers for entry-level positions, and second, to prepare students to successfully complete the Registry (certification) with either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI). Faculty and staff emphasize “personalized attention” to ensure the success of CVIU students in fulfilling both these objectives.","Not applicable, not in Carnegie universe (not accredited or nondegree-granting)",None,Not applicable,"Institution does not accept dual, credit for life, or AP credits",2,2,n/a,"$17,980",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"$5,615",24%,76%,2%,6%,7%,0%,0%,85%,0%,0%,0%,46%,54%,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0%,100%,n/a,n/a,open admission policy contact institution for more information,"This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The programs we offer at Alaska Career College are neither the shortest nor the least expensive, but we believe they are the best.

We believe that these educational goals are best served by demanding of our students active participation in the planning of their own programs, and in the regulation of their own lives on campus. Student freedom is not the absence of restraint, however; it is rather the fullest possible substitution of habits of self-restraint for restraint imposed by others.
