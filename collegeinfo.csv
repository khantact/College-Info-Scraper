CVIU sets high academic standards for its students and ensures students have a thorough understanding of the ultrasound principles, technology, and competency skills needed to confidently pursue a career in cardiovascular ultrasound. The didactic components are integrated with the practical application of ultrasound sonography through scanning labs and on-site application of the knowledge and competencies learned in the classroom. Any student completing any CVIU program will possess complete confidence in pursuing a career in ultrasound sonography. The goals of our faculty, staff, and clinical supervisors are twofold: first, to thoroughly train sonographers for entry-level positions, and second, to prepare students to successfully complete the Registry (certification) with either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI). Faculty and staff emphasize “personalized attention” to ensure the success of CVIU students in fulfilling both these objectives.","Not applicable, not in Carnegie universe (not accredited or nondegree-granting)",None,Not applicable,"Institution does not accept dual, credit for life, or AP credits",2,2,n/a,"$17,980 ",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"$5,615 ",24%,76%,2%,6%,7%,0%,0%,85%,0%,0%,0%,46%,54%,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0%,100%,n/a,n/a,n/a,"This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.","This institution does not admit full-time first-time degree/certificate-seeking students, therefore admission information was not reported.",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

The field of veterinary medicine is continually evolving, and Bel-Rea utilizes institutional goal achievement, student outcomes, and input from veterinary professionals to study and consistently improve our efforts for our students, faculty, staff, veterinary employers, and the professional community. The program’s educational philosophy is that the student is considered our most valuable asset, and it is the well- being and training of the student that is our most important consideration. Bel-Rea’s educational objectives actively support this mindset and are as follows: 1. To assist all students in achieving a superior level of basic skills for an entry-level veterinary technician. 2. To instill in each student the means of developing a professional appearance, poise and a continuing pattern for self-improvement. 3. To impart a practical knowledge of appropriate procedures and techniques, with emphasis on learning by doing. 4. To provide a background diverse enough to enable graduates to progress to management level. 5. To give the student the opportunity to exercise responsibility, and to develop the self-confidence that goes with responsibility. 6.

Its primary objective is to produce Talmudic scholars and to thereby provide firm, lifelong foundations for its students, graduates and their communities. Beth Medrash Govoha strives to offer the broadest Talmudic curriculum available in any such institute in the world, providing its students with the opportunity to study almost any area in the widest spectrum of Talmudic study. Beth Medrash Govoha is dedicated to helping its students achieve the highest level of scholarship along with intensive commitment to academic excellence in every area of Talmudic Studies. This is achieved both through unique scope in the student body and through a broad array of Talmudic Studies programs, which surpass that of any other institute in the world. Beth Medrash Govoha carries out its objectives through its undergraduate and graduate divisions and through its community based programs. The Beth Medrash Govoha undergraduate school is a five-year college; the Rabbi Aaron Kotler Institute for Advanced Learning is the graduate school. The undergraduate school is designed to provide the student with a thorough foundation in the core areas of Talmud, in accord with the classic model of such scholarship. The school also prepares students to integrate scholarly training into their personal and professional lives. The Rabbi Aaron Kotler Institute for Advanced Learning promotes advanced scholarship and research in classical Talmudic and cognate studies. In addition, it is concerned with professional orientation by providing programs to prepare these scholars as teachers and administrators in secondary schools and institutions of higher Talmudic studies, and in other forms of community service.

It seeks to liberate and nurture the individuality, the creative intelligence, and the ethical and aesthetic sensibility of its students, to the end that their richly varied natural endowments will be directed toward self-fulfillment and toward constructive social purposes. We believe that these educational goals are best served by demanding of our students active participation in the planning of their own programs, and in the regulation of their own lives on campus. Student freedom is not the absence of restraint, however; it is rather the fullest possible substitution of habits of self-restraint for restraint imposed by others. The exercise of student freedom is the very condition of a meaningful education, and an essential aspect of the nurture of free citizens, dedicated to civilized values and capable of creative and constructive membership in modern society.",Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus,"Distance education – undergraduate courses offered, programs not offered,Distance education – graduate courses offered, programs not offered,Study abroad",Not applicable,"Dual credit,Credit for life experiences,Advanced placement (AP) credits",60,74,n/a,"$59,638 ","$1,000 ","$17,210 ","$80,648 ",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"$23,673 ","$43,739 ",36%,64%,1%,2%,3%,11%,0%,59%,4%,3%,18%,94%,6%,2%,82%,16%,n/a,n/a,9%,92%,9%,92%,n/a,"1,726",67%,22%,Recommended,Recommended,Required,Recommended,Required,Considered but not required,Required,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,84%,68%,25%,71%,66%,n/a,80%,40%,70%,0%,67%,57%,82%,80%,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,5,35,
